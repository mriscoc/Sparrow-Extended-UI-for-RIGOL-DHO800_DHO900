# Sparrow Extended UI for the RIGOL DHO800 DHO900 series oscilloscopes

This is the official repository for the proyect Sparrow Extended UI. This project began by gathering ideas and contributions from the community of users of Rigol DHO800 and DHO900 series oscilloscopes, mainly on the [Eevblog forum](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/hacking-the-rigol-dho800900-scope). Other projects to customize the original interface were started later. If you visit that forum, you can find a historical compilation of the ideas implemented in this modification. In early 2024, the first layout changes of the measurement panel and a little reorganization of the UI elements were presented in the forum, and the [first public release](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/hacking-the-rigol-dho800900-scope/msg5470243/#msg5470243) was presented, as well as the first demonstration of the [full screen mode](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/hacking-the-rigol-dho800900-scope/msg5471431/#msg5471431). A new [header bar](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/hacking-the-rigol-dho800900-scope/msg5471554/#msg5471554) was shown in April 2024 and released in the Github repository. Finally, a video showing the modifications made up to May 2024 [was published on YouTube](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/hacking-the-rigol-dho800900-scope/msg5504275/#msg5504275). Many more modifications have been made over time. At the end of 2025, Rigol launched the MHO900 series of oscilloscopes, applying many of the ideas from this project to the user interface of these instruments.

⚠️ Over time, other customization projects appeared with similar names, which has caused confusion. This document refers exclusively to this **ORIGINAL Sparrow Extended** project.
